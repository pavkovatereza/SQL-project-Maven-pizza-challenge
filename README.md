## üìö Data Science Job Salaries Dataset
This dataset, available at [Maven Analytics Playground](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-pizza-challenge), contains information about sales of Plato‚Äôs Pizza, the Greek-inspired pizza restaurant, from 2015. It has 4 tables with information about orders and sales details, pizza types, and prices.  

Dataset was analyzed using MySQL, the code used for analysis can be found in [this](https://github.com/pavkovatereza/SQL-project-Maven-pizza-challenge/blob/main/Maven_pizza_challenge.sql) repository.

Visualization will be available in the upcoming days.

## ‚ùì Questions
The goal for this analysis is to identify possible areas of improvement to get better sales and optimized operations. With this goal in mind I was looking to get the following questions answered:

  - What is the total amount of orders and how many pizzas had been sold in 2015?
  - What months, days in a week, and hours are the busiest?
  - What is the daily average of orders/pizzas?
  - What is the average price per order and how many pizzas are in an average order?
  - What are the 3 most and least sold pizza types?
  - What size is preferred?
  - What category is the most favorite and what pizzas in each category are the most favorite?
  - What is the total revenue per year/month?
  - Does season affect sales?
  - What pizza brought the most and the least revenue?
  - Are the variety of the ingredients used in pizzas optimized?

## üö© Datasets limitations and issues
1. The following days are missing from the dataset: 24th, 25th of September, 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th of October, and 25th of December (probably closed due to the holiday). All missing days from October are Mondays. The monthly/daily average will be used instead of the total to compare sales.
2. Information about takeaway/delivery orders or eat-in is not included. Such information will be useful for further analysis to optimize seating availability and amount of workers needed in the kitchen/on the floor.
3. There are some pizzas that doesn't have any sales in some particular sizes. Could be a system fault or actual data - data source needs to be checked.

## üéØ Conclusion
The dataset provides valuable insight into the sales of Plato‚Äôs Pizza from the year 2015. For further analysis, I would recommend tracking which orders were placed for take-away and orders to eat in, and also information about the approximate cost of used ingredients (product cost). This information could be used to optimize the number of workers needed on specific days and times and the number of seats needed for guests in the restaurant. Knowing the product cost for each pizza will allow for analyzing the actual profit from selling each pizza (the most sold one or the one with the most revenue doesn‚Äôt need to be the most profitable one).

The majority of orders were placed between 11 and 23 with rush hours 12-14 and 17-19. Orders after 10 pm are not very common except for Friday and Saturday. I would recommend changing the opening hours to Su-Th 11-22 Fr+Sa 11-23. Due to the decreasing amount of orders after rush hours I would suggest creating some special offers for orders after 21 for weekdays (Mo-Th) or before 12 for weekends (Saturday and Sunday early lunch). 

The dataset shows there are pizza types that don't have any sales in some particular size option (The Big Meat small, Four Cheese medium and large, Five Cheese large). To reflect this information I would recommend checking the ordering system to make sure all entries are saved accordingly.

As the restaurant has only the Greek pizza in XL and XXL sizes with 552 and 28 pieces sold/year respectively. I would consider removing XXL size and adding more options (the most sold/favorite types) for the XL size and creating a weekend/lunch offer for XL pizzas. The effectiveness of this step should be reviewed with new data.

The Brie Carre pizza is the most expensive ($23.65) and available only in a small size. With 490 pieces sold it brought the lowest revenue of $11.5k. Ingredients for this pizza are unique and the majority are not used in any other pizza. The manager/chef should review options for either changing ingredients to ones that are commonly used in the restaurant and changing the recipe to make the pizza more affordable or considering taking the pizza off the menu.
